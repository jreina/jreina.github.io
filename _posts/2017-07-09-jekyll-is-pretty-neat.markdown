I only discovered that Github hosts personal web sites a few days ago. I knew that you could set up a `gh_pages` branch and have it hosted at `user.github.io/project`, but the idea of hosting my own personal site on Github using a repo is pretty neat.

I took the bait.

I found [a Github help tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) explaining how to set up Jekyll, a static site generator, to run locally. After following the steps in the article, I emerged with what appears to be a functioning Jekyll site.
